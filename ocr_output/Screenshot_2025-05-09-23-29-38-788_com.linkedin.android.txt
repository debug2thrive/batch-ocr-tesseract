— Break them. Debug them. Make them production-ready.
— After learning something, use it in a project or teach it to someone.

Your growth as a data engineer won't come from watching videos.
It'll come from understanding where pipelines break at 2 AM.
From figuring out why joins fail, why jobs lag, and how to fix them.

Don’t chase surface-level “learning.”
Build real skills by doing the hard, boring, practical stuff.

That’s what sets good engineers apart from great ones.
